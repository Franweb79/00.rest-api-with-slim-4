<h2> <b>THIS IS A SIMPLE REST API BUILT WITH SLIM 4 FRAMEWORK</b> </h2>

<p>This API is intended to be used with learning purposes, and maybe as general backend for future projects</p>

<ol>


<li>on .gitignore we will ignore the following folders
<ul>
<li>docs -  because are guides or notes only interesting for a personal use </li>
<li>vendor - because it would make sync much bigger. All those files can be downloaded and installed again through the command <i>"composer install"</i>,  once composer is installed on your equip. for more info please check <a href="https://getcomposer.org/"><b>https://getcomposer.org/</b></a></li>
</ul>
</li> 

<li><b> possibility of making a request through software like <a href="https://www.postman.com/">postman.</a></b>
<ul>
<li><b>params names</b> to be used (under construction):</li>
<ul>

</ul>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
    <b>To be improved on new versions:</b>
    <ul>
        <li>config/Item-model.php: for now will only be used a method to insert new items, and will be called on the post-new-item-control.php but maybe in the future we could create methods to getItem and getItems, now this code is done on each route designed for each tasks. Maybe that way is more clean code</li>
        <li>Maybe the routes to get all items and one item, I could make it not to bo opened on a new tab which only show JSON formatted data, and to be shown with styles and a back button to make navigation more comfortable </li>
    </ul>
</li>

 
</ol>
