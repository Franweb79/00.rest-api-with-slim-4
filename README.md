#   LOGIN FORM: Validation on well formed email and so maybe is not needed on the login form, like it is on the register form, #   since simply cheking if they exist on the DB could be enough; but I think is a good idea to practice and maybe is great to #   save queries to the database. I mean, only the needed queries will be done.
